**The story** 
Wildfires wreak havoc every year.
They take human and animal lives. They destroy agricultural and industrial crops and cause famines.
They damage the environment, contribute to global warming, and generate smoke that pollutes the air.
Their overall impact runs into billions of dollars and includes incalculable harm to people and animals.

In this hackathon, you are going to build a wildfire early warning system for the fictional island nation of Zakar.

**Goals** 
1 - Visualization dashboard 
2 - Model for early alarm

**Preparing the environment** 
python -m venv .venv  
.venv\Scripts\activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt

create a file ".env" e fill the variables:  
HOST=< host memphis >  
USER=< user memphis >  
PWD=< password memphis >  
ID=< id memphis >  

run python prediction.py --> it will read the new messages of each new day from sensors and it will produce alert messages in case of firewood
